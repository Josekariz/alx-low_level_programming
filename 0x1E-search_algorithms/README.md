# C - Search Algorithms

## Learning Objectives
This project, titled "0x1E. C - Search Algorithms," provides an opportunity to delve into fundamental search algorithms. By the end of this project, you will gain insights into:

- Understanding search algorithms
- Implementing linear search and binary search
- Determining the best search algorithm based on specific needs

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specified options
- Code follows the Betty style
- No global variables allowed
- Maximum of 5 functions per file
- Use only the printf function from the standard library
- Prototypes of all functions included in the header file `search_algos.h`
- Header files include guards
- Follow specified big O notation formats for writing time and space complexities

## Tasks

### 0. Linear Search
Write a function `linear_search` that searches for a value in an array using the Linear search algorithm.

### 1. Binary Search
Implement the Binary search algorithm in a function `binary_search` for searching in a sorted array.

### 2. Big O #0
Define the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n.

### 3. Big O #1
Determine the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n.

### 4. Big O #2
Specify the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.

### 5. Big O #3
Identify the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.

### 6. Big O #4
Evaluate the space complexity of a given function/algorithm for allocating a 2D array.
